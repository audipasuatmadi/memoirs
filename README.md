# Memoirs
## Background
This project is born out of a problem on my personal experience. I got irritated whenever I import references file as Microsoft Word's xml from Mendeley, I have to edit some of the source xml to be compatible with my Microsoft Word.

This program is made to automate just that above. I decided to make it open-source at GitHub in case anyone experience the same issue with Mendeley's Microsoft Word export as I am.

Here's an example of a corrupted Mendeley's `Sources.xml` on Microsoft Word.

Here's an example of a fixed Mendeley's `Sources.xml` after using memoirs.
